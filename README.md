# COVID-19 Project Information

Data used in this project were cloned in RStudio from the ["COVIDProject" GitHub repository](https://github.com/annyrodriguez/COVIDProject), which contains COVID-19 metrics for all regions, states, core-based statistical areas, and counties in the United States from December 17th, 2020 to July 7th, 2022. The data were downloaded from the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention's open data repository](https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report/gqxm-d9w9/about_data) and cleaned by a team of researchers at Florida International University.

Project 3 materials were submitted as an assignment for the 'PHC6701: Advanced R Computing' course at Florida International University. The goals for this assignment were to clean and harmonize the data and to visualize trends in the COVID-19 test percent positivity rates for four Florida counties using Excel, R, and the Tidyverse package.
